# GLB-Viewer
This project is a simple web-based 3D viewer that loads and displays .glb (GLTF Binary) models directly in the browser using Three.js.

The website renders a 3D scene with a perspective camera, lighting, and interactive orbit controls, allowing users to rotate, zoom, and inspect the model in real time. The project uses modern ES modules and runs in the browser without any build tools, making it easy to set up and customize.

It is suitable for portfolios, school projects, and basic 3D visualization on the web.

Technologies used:

-HTML5

-JavaScript (ES Modules)

-Three.js

-GLTFLoader
